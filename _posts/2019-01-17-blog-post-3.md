The *Strategic Organization* made available a virtual special issue compiling the research method articles published in the journal. Bascle (2008) and Hamilton and Nickerson (2003), for instance, are must-read papers about endogeneity for Ph.D. students. The *Credibility crisis in strategic management research* paper, from Bergh and colleagues (2017), is also a must-read for anyone who does research in strategy.

You can access the virtual issue at the link [Virtual Special Issue: SO! Methods Collection](https://journals.sagepub.com/page/soq/collections/virtual-special-issue/so-methods).

Kudos to Russ Coff, Teppo Felin, Ann Langley, and Tim Rowley, coeditors, for implementing the virtual special issue.

The *American Economic Association* has an excellent webcast about the complementarities and differences between machine learning and econometrics. [Susan Athey](https://twitter.com/Susan_Athey) and Guido Imbens did an amazing job making the materials accessible to everyone. You can access the webcast at the link [Machine Learning and Econometrics](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts). Materials are available at [Google Drive ML folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SEEOMluxBcSAb_tsDYgcLFtOQaeWtkLp).

I also recommend [Susan Athey's](https://twitter.com/Susan_Athey) talk at the NeurIPS 2018 about counterfactual inference. [![counterfactual inference](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yKs6msnw9m8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKs6msnw9m8 "Counterfactual inference")

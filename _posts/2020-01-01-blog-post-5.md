Machine Learning Tokyo, a nonprofit organization dedicated to democratizing Machine Learning, compiled several lectures about deep learning in this [github repository](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/AI_Curriculum). I highly recommend the Introduction to Deep Learning and NLP with Deep Learning courses.

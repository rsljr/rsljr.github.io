I am a Ph.D. student in Business Administration/Strategy at the University of Memphis.

My research interest is to understand the mutual influence between firms and "environments" (Industry, Science, State, Society/Culture, and Technology) in the generating of markets and social changes. I am also interested in Research Methods, especially in the application of natural language processing and machine learning to strategy research.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Business Administration - Strategy at the University of Memphis.

My research program examines a) the influence of organizational elites on firmsâ€™ strategic actions, b) nonmarket dynamics, and c) the dynamics of field of management and research methods.

I work with Python, R, and Stata. I value transparency, reproducibility, and rigor as much as a good theory.

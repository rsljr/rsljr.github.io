I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Business Administration - Strategy at the University of Memphis.

My research focuses on the influence of institutions, social issues, and top management team on firm strategies. Topics related to research methods and the dynamics of the academic field of management complement my research interests.

I work with Python, R, and Stata. I value transparency, reproducibility, and rigor as much as a good theory.

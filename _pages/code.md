This page has resources I have developed and gathered over the years. Feel free to use them.

## edgarParser ##

EDGAR database contains several types of filings that public companies are required to submit to SEC. Although EDGAR is a rich source of data, gathering the data from it can be not straightforward. The repository [edgarParser](https://github.com/rsljr/python-edgar), has some of the scripts that I coded to gather data about inside trading (3, 4, and 5 filings), 10-k (annual reports) filings, 8-k (disclosure) filings, 13f (institutional investors) filings, and executive compensation (DEF 14A filings) from EDGAR.  

## Instruments for National Cultural Values ##

Based on Nash and Patel's discussion of instruments for national cultural values, I compiled a repository with the data of several instruments cited in the paper. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/rsljr/cultural_values_instrumental_variables).

## Other resources ##

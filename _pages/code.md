To support my research, I have coded small scripts to fix specific problems. I made some of them available to make possibly the life of fellow researchers easier.

## Python - SEC: EDGAR ##

EDGAR database contains several types of fillings that public companies are required to submit to SEC. Although EDGAR is a rich source of data, gathering the data from it can be not straightforward. The repository [python-edgar](https://github.com/rsljr/python-edgar), has some of the scripts that I coded to gather data about inside trading, 8-k fillings and executive compensation from EDGAR.  

For more details about my code, please concat me via email.

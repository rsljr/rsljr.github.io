## How Do Firms That Are Changing the World Engage Politically? ##

There is a movement to push firms to focus on policies and practices that enhance their competitiveness while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which the firm operates, the shared value firms. In this article, we examine how shared value firms deploy their political efforts, whether they seek alignment with their social goals, and how this alignment affects their financial performance. Using a matched-sample design with public firms listed in the Change the World list in 2018 and 2019, we find that shared value firms have more political breadth, connection, and PAC contributions than firms in the control group. However, our findings indicate that shared value firms are not more likely to align their social and political efforts. We also find that firms with aligned social and political efforts do not have a better financial performance. These findings have important implications for the literature on firm social and political efforts.

## Assessing the methodological differences between Brazilian journals and top journals in strategy ##

The discussion about the quality of academic publication in Brazil has been a constant in the last decades. In this article, we evaluate the methodological differences between papers published in Brazilian journals and  papers published in AMJ, OS, ASQ, JMS and SMJ in field of strategy from 2006 to 2015. Based on a systematic review of 1294 empirical papers, we identify and describe methodological differences, offering a benchmark to improve future studies. Specifically, we find that Brazilian papers can be carachterized as testers, reinforcing results found by other studies about the necessity of developing the Brazilian strategy field to be more competitive with the international field at large. We discuss the reasons those differences exist and their implications towards advancing the field of strategy. Then, we suggest forms of overcoming the current constraints and improving the quality of our research to help to consider the Brazilian reality.
